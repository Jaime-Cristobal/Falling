# Falling

##### Objective is to collect as much coins as possible without dying.
##### There is a timer until enemies/obstacles start to get faster. You have to collect a certain amount
##### of coins for the timer to gain more time

##### Possible idea: knock the coin/timers using physics with the player to the side to gain points/score

## -------------------------------------------------

##### Player -> gesture controlled 
##### Coins -> used to score and give to collectors
##### Collectors -> push coins to collector using physics to score
##### Bandits -> can steal your points & destroy coins
##### Enemies -> instantly ends the game
